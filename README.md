# CrewSearch
A badly made Node.js cli app which can bruteforce Among Us game codes on public Crewlink servers to gather information on active users. You could probably use it for a bunch of different things, but the main use case is most likely to find streamers Among Us codes while using Crewlink.

## Why
I have brain damage

## How do I run this
1. Install Node.js (and npm)
2. Install by running `npm i -g crewsearch` in a terminal
3. You can now use `crewsearch` in your terminal

## License
This code is garbage why would I ever want to give it a license
