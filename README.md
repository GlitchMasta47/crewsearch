# CrewSearch
A badly made Node.js script that bruteforces Among Us game codes on public Crewlink servers to gather information on active users. You could probably use it for a bunch of different things, but the main use case is most likely to find streamers Among Us codes while using Crewlink.

## Why
I have brain damage

## How do I run this
Install Node.js, `npm install`, do some other stuff, just run the index.js file with Node. It shouldn't be hard to figure it out from there.

## License
This code is garbage why would I ever want to give it a license
